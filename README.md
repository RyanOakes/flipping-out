#Flipping Out



Create a function to flip a coin. It is up to you to determine what this returns to signify heads or tails.

Then create a function to run a simulation of flipping a coin n number of times, default 216, recording how many heads and tails it has at different intervals. The intervals are exponential, so record at 20, 21, 22, and so on until you reach n. Record the final number as well.

Then make a line plot of the difference between heads and tails at each recorded point, and another with the ratio of heads to tails at each recorded point.
