#Flipping Out


##Objective

Create a function to flip a coin. It is up to you to determine what this returns to signify heads or tails.

Then create a function to run a simulation of flipping a coin n number of times, default 216, recording how many heads and tails it has at different intervals. The intervals are exponential, so record at 20, 21, 22, and so on until you reach n. Record the final number as well.

Then make a line plot of the difference between heads and tails at each recorded point, and another with the ratio of heads to tails at each recorded point.


##Instruction
This program was written in Python 3. 

After fulfilling the requirements.txt obligations, you will generate n (quantity up to you) coin tosses, then graph them. 

The first line graph, Difference, shows the differnce (e.g. two heads, one tails equals a difference of one) over the course of the flips. 

The second line graph, Ratio, shows the ratio difference over the course of the flips. 

The intervals are exponential and recorded until n tosses conclude.
